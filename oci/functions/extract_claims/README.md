# `extract-claims`

Third OCI Function in the thesis pipeline. It reads the article bodies already
written under `silver/body/`, skips rows without a body and rows whose body
extraction status is not `OK`, and extracts a candidate medical claim with
either OCI Generative AI or the public Gemini API. For Google Gemini, one
request analyzes several articles and returns one validated JSON item per
`record_id`, reducing API calls and rate-limit pressure. The Google API key is
read at invocation time from OCI Vault and is never stored in the image or
repo.

The model is used only to structure the article into a candidate claim and to
prepare a faithful English rendering plus a PubMed search query. It does not
decide whether the claim is true or false. Human review and evidence are
required later.

## Configuration

```text
OBJECT_STORAGE_NAMESPACE=idur1kkrru56
OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET=mednews-data
SILVER_BODY_PREFIX=silver/body
SILVER_CLAIMS_PREFIX=silver/claims
LLM_MODEL_ID=google.gemini-2.5-flash
LLM_REGION=us-ashburn-1
GENAI_COMPARTMENT_ID=<Cloud compartment OCID>
LLM_MAX_ROWS=0
LLM_REQUEST_BATCH_SIZE=10
LLM_MAX_SECONDS=150
LLM_TIME_BUFFER=10
LLM_MAX_BODY_CHARS=12000
LLM_MAX_TOKENS=3000
LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.0
LLM_TOP_P=0.9
LLM_MAX_RETRIES=0
```

When OCI Generative AI model quota is unavailable, use the Google provider:

```text
LLM_PROVIDER=google
LLM_MODEL_ID=gemini-3.5-flash-lite
GOOGLE_GEMINI_SECRET_OCIDS=<OCI Vault secret OCID API 1>,<OCI Vault secret OCID API 2>
# GOOGLE_GEMINI_SECRET_OCID remains supported for one key.
```

Each secret must contain one Gemini API key as plain text. The Function reads
both secrets at invocation time, rotates them round-robin and fails over to the
other project on quota, authentication, or rate-limit errors. The dynamic
group must be allowed to read both secrets. The request uses the
`generateContent` endpoint and sends the key in the `x-goog-api-key` header.
`llm_key_slot` records which loaded slot produced each row without exposing the
key.

Each OCI Event identifies one `silver/body/*.csv` object. The Function reads
only that source file, excludes body rows whose extraction was not `OK`, and
writes its corresponding Claims CSV. Record IDs already present in
`silver/claims/` are skipped only to make a duplicated delivery of the same
event idempotent; rows from earlier Body files are never pulled into the run.
`LLM_MAX_ROWS=0` means process every eligible body from the triggering object.
Set it to a positive value only for a deliberate cap; a cap smaller than the
event file is rejected instead of silently spilling rows into another run.
`LLM_REQUEST_BATCH_SIZE` limits the number of rows sent in one Gemini request;
the recommended value 10 keeps each prompt bounded while the function sends
the next request in the same invocation. Eligible rows include
`claim_text_en` and `pubmed_query_en`, so the evidence Function can query
English PubMed abstracts without another Gemini request. The Function writes
successful rows when the internal time budget is reached. If Gemini is
unavailable, the quota is exhausted, or a response does not contain one valid
item per input row, every affected article is written with `llm_status=ERROR`
and an explicit reason; it does not remain pending for another scheduled run.
HTTP 4xx, quota, rate-limit, and malformed JSON failures are not retried
inside the same invocation, so a failed request does not consume a duplicate
API call.

The current request batch is 10 rows. With 50 eligible bodies in the triggering
file this means five
Gemini requests, alternating the two configured project keys. The actual time
is dominated by body length, response tokens and project quota. See
[`docs/limits_and_timing.md`](../../../docs/limits_and_timing.md) for the
provider, quota and retry matrix.

## Output

Successful invocations write a CSV such as:

```text
silver/claims/claims_run_20261005T000000Z_ab12cd34.csv
```

The output keeps the Bronze and body columns and adds `claim_text`,
`claim_text_en`, `pubmed_query_en`, `query_status`, `query_prompt_version`,
`is_medical`, `is_claim_eligible`, `claim_type`, `llm_reason`,
`needs_human_review`, `llm_status`, `llm_error`, `llm_raw_json`, `model_id`,
`llm_key_slot`, `prompt_version`, timestamps, and source object/run identifiers.

## Manual invocation

```bash
oci fn function invoke \
  --function-id <extract-claims-function-ocid> \
  --file - \
  --body '{"data":{"resourceName":"silver/body/<input>.csv","additionalDetails":{"bucketName":"mednews-data"}}}' \
  --region us-ashburn-1 \
  --read-timeout 360
```
